# Bash Minishell

Bash shell that supports changing directories, exec-ing commands, and handling signals. This was created by myself and Uri Korin.

## Usage

1. Run the following command in the **src/** directory to compile the minishell executable: `make`
2. Once compiled, you can run the shell: `./minishell`
